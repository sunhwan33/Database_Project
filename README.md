# Database_Project
 
## This is what I practiced in 'Database', a 24-1 HGU class. (Prof. Charmgil Hong)
## Phase 1
In phase 1, we received 2,400,228 records made up of 45 columns and had to model this raw data into formatted data.
Result: queries for creating Views and ER-Diagram.
## Phase 2
For modeled data from phase 1, we had to make queries for certain purpose and optimze them.

Our team optimzed queries by

Examining each implemented queries whether it contains unnecessary calculation and remove them
Adopting index for proper tables.
Result: Optimized queries satisfying their objectives, achieving low average speed (ms), and it was selected as the best result and report in the class.
